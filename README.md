# Project-2
This project was part of my bioinformatics class.
The Scientific Question was: Is increased ACE2 gene expression in lungs of current smokers correlated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adult current-smokers? 
The Scientific Hypothesis was: If current smokers have a higher ACE2 gene expression in lungs compared to nonsmokers, then their rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection per 100,000 (p-value<0.05) compared to nonsmokers will also be higher. 
Data: There are two input data files:1) Smoking_Data.xlxs 2) Seq_Data.fastq
The Smoking_Data.xlxs was compiled using various published studies, which are listed in the excel file along with the data extracted from the respective studies. 
The Seq_Data.fastq is a transcriptome dataset obtained from www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJEB4337/.
